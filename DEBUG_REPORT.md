# 🔍 DEBUG REPORT - Marketing Analytics System

## ✅ **BUGS FOUND & FIXED**

### **1. CRITICAL: Missing Daily Report Submission Function**
**Issue:** The `handleDailyReportSubmit` function was referenced but never defined.  
**Impact:** Daily reports couldn't be submitted - complete feature failure.  
**Fix:** Added complete function at line 6673 with:
- Form data collection
- Traffic source and VIP fan data extraction
- API call to `/api/daily-reports`
- Success/error handling
- Form reset after successful submission

### **2. CRITICAL: Marketing Dashboard Using Wrong Data Source**
**Issue:** Dashboard was querying `TrafficSourcePerformance` (empty table) instead of `FanPurchase`.  
**Impact:** Marketing dashboard would show no data even with sales logged.  
**Fix:** Rewrote `/api/marketing/dashboard` endpoint to:
- Query `FanPurchase` with date filters
- Aggregate data by traffic source in real-time
- Calculate quality scores dynamically
- Track VIP fans properly
- Return properly formatted data
