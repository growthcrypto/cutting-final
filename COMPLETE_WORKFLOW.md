**Funnel Efficiency:**
- **Link Clicks:** How many clicked your OF link
- **Spenders:** How many actually spent money
- **Spender Rate:** Clicks → Spenders conversion %
  - ✅ 3%+ = Excellent
  - ⚠️ 1.5-3% = Average  
  - 🔴 <1.5% = Poor

**Revenue:**
- **Total:** Revenue from this source
- **Per Click:** ROI metric (revenue ÷ clicks)
  - ✅ $2.00+ = Excellent
  - ⚠️ $1.00-2.00 = Average
  - 🔴 <$1.00 = Poor

- **Tracked:** VIP fans we have firstSeenDate for
- **Retained:** Still active 7 days after first purchase
- **Rate:** Retention %
  - ✅ 70%+ = Excellent
  - ⚠️ 50-70% = Average

- This is the key decision-making metric

## **🎯 MAKING DECISIONS**

### **Scenario 1: Same Revenue, Different Quality**

```
Reddit:  $450, 150 clicks, 8 spenders (5.3%), 88% retention → A+
Twitter: $450, 320 clicks, 6 spenders (1.9%), 33% retention → C
```

**Decision:** Scale Reddit, fix or cut Twitter!
- Reddit is 2.8x more efficient (5.3% vs 1.9%)
- Reddit fans stick around (88% vs 33%)
- Reddit = $3.00 per click, Twitter = $1.41 per click

### **Scenario 2: Limited Budget**

```
You have $500 for traffic this week.

Reddit:  5.3% conversion, $3.00 per click → A+
Twitter: 1.9% conversion, $1.41 per click → C
```

**Decision:** Put $400 on Reddit, $100 on Twitter
- Reddit will likely return $1,200 (3x ROI)
- Twitter will likely return $141 (1.4x ROI)

### **Scenario 3: New Source Testing**

```
Instagram: Only 2 weeks of data
- 50 clicks, 3 spenders (6.0%), $120 revenue
- Spender rate even better than Reddit!
```

**Decision:** Gradually scale Instagram
- Good early signals
- Need more data to confirm retention
- Monitor quality score as you scale
